# Linux 

For aspiring devops engineers, it is essential to know linux, shell or bash scripting. The answer is, itâ€™s very important. The following image shows the Stackoverflow 2021 survey, where 27% of the respondents said they use shell scripting.

But most of the time, I get asked, saying that there are many automation tools out there and do we still need to learn and write shell scripts? The answer is yes. We no more create shell scripts for full-fledged automation but we use scripting along with automation tools and for ad-hoc tasks.
For example, if you use the AWS user data option, there is a chance you will use a shell script inside it. Another example is, while creating AMI images using a packer, you will end up using a shell script for the AMI configuration. Also, I have had instances where I had to use shell scripts with configuration management tools, containers, etc. We will talk more about this in the following sections.
Also, shell script comes in handy for repeatable development tasks. For example, it could be spinning up a Vagrant VM with the essential software or setting up the development environment itself.
Most importantly, hands-on scripting and programming are becoming mandatory in preliminary interview rounds in DevOps interviews. So it is another crucial reason why you should learn shell scripting.
